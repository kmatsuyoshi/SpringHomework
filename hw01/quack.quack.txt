HW01 -- ...We Go!
2017-01-31w

Caroline and I have been in touch last term. One December afternoon, it was pouring outside, so we 
took refuge in the nearby Pret-a-Manger. I sat down with her to do my APCS homework, but I found myself
stuck 30 minutes into the assignment. After talking with her, I realized my mistake and it seemed as if
the clouds above disappeared and a rainbow wrapped around the earth like the ribbon on Caroline's neck.
This adventure furthers the idea that ducks can bring clarity into your life of thinking.
