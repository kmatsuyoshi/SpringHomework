2x2 

qn	nq
nq	qn

No solutions
Placing one queen in each column and making sure that both occupy all the rows already creates an error in the state, because queens can attack diagonally, meaning that if the queens cannot be on the same diagonal.
This case is unsolveable and there are no solutions for this case.

3x3 

qnn	qnn	nqn	nqn	nnq 
nnq	nqn	qnn	nnq	qnn
nqn	nnq	nnq	qnn	nqn

No solutions
There are also errors in the example states for a 3x3 board, where a queen is not on a diagonal with one queen, it is on the diagonal of another.
Hence, there are no solutions for this case, meaning it is unsolvable.

4x4 
	 vv	 vv
qnnn	nnqn	nqnn
nnqn	qnnn	nnnq
nqnn	nnnq	qnnn
nnnq	nqnn	nnqn
 
2 solutions
Using evidence from the outcomes above, there are 2 solutions because the process of placing exactly one queen in each row and each column results in no queens being on each others' diagonal path for a state and its mirrored version. Therefore, the case is solveable.

5x5
	  v       v
nnnnq	nnnqn	nqnnn	
qnnnn	qnnnn	nnnnq	
nnnqn	nnqnn	nnqnn	
nqnnn	nnnnq	qnnnn	
nnqnn	nqnnn	nnnqn	

2 solutions
The pattern repeats in this case as well, where two states demonstrate that no queens will eventually share the same diagonal, with all being in different rows and columns, making it solveable. 

6x6

nnqnnn	
qnnnnn	
nnnnqn	
nqnnnn	
nnnnnq	
nnnqnn	

No solutions
There are again no solutions for this unsolveable case due to previously stated reasons.

7x7

nnnnnqn
nnnqnnn
nqnnnnn
nnnnnnq
qnnnnnn
nnqnnnn
nnnnqnn

No solutions
This case is unsolvable as well, using the same reasoning as before.

8x8

qnnnnnnn
nnqnnnnn
nnnnqnnn
nqnnnnnn
nnnqnnnn
nnnnnqnn
nnnnnnnq
nnnnnnqn

No solutions
Finally, it can be concluded that there are no states that satisfy the condition for an 8x8 chess board case, even using the "L shape" method, meant to prevent queens from intersecting at diagonals. At the end of this utilization, the queens eventually meet on the same diagonal. Therefore, this case is unsolveable, as well as all the ones above, and it is impossible to place n queens on an nxn chess board such that none of them can attack each other.
